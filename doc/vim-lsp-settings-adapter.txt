INTRODUCTION                                  *vim-lsp-settings-adapter*

This plugin allows using mattn/|vim-lsp-settings| with yegappan/|lsp| to easily
install and manage LSP servers for Vim 9.

CAVEATS

Some servers don't seem to work that well, the workspace info isn't currently
transferred, not sure if that would be needed.
